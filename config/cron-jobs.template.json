For each post, craft a reply that:\n- Adds a specific insight or data point\n- Mentions a personal experience briefly\n- Asks a smart question OR makes a counter-intuitive observation\n- Is NOT generic cheerleading\n- References the product ONLY if genuinely relevant (max 1 in 7)\n\n4. Use browser automation (profile=openclaw) to:\n- Navigate to each post\n- Post the reply\n- Like the original post\n\n5.
