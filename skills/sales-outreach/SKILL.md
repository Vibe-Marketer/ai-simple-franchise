## The 4-Point Reddit/DM Reply Framework (MANDATORY — Non-Negotiable)

Every reply to a Reddit post or DM must answer these 4 questions, IN ORDER. If any of the 4 are missing, the draft is NOT done.

**1. Who am I and why should this specific person listen to me?**
Authority + relevance in one sentence. Reference the exact audience you serve.
- RIGHT: "after building these for 7, 8, and 9-fig owners who've gone through exactly that cycle"
- WRONG: "What I've noticed is..." (bystander, no authority)

**2. What patterns have I seen solving this for paying clients?**
Proof through patterns, NOT opinions. "What I've seen with clients is…" not "What I think is…"
- RIGHT: "It's not at all uncommon for me to see clients: [3 specific failure patterns]"
- WRONG: "The thing about these tools is..." (opinion, no proof)

**3. What's one simple framework / checklist they can steal right now?**
Concrete, stealable, actionable. Bullets or steps. Something they can act on before we ever talk.
- RIGHT: "-- one role, one process, one KPI / -- 5–10 deterministic steps / -- clear owner for maintenance"
- WRONG: Explaining concepts without giving a tool

**4. What's a zero-pressure next step framed as value, not a pitch?**
Soft. Framed as something for THEM. Never "want to hop on a call?" on touch 1.
- RIGHT: "If it would help I can share the one-pager we use with clients to spec that first AI role..."
- WRONG: "Would love to connect and show you what we do"

**The position to write from:** You are NOT a smart bystander offering an opinion. You are the pro who has already solved this 10 times for people just like them. Every word should come from that place.

## Authority Through Curiosity Framework

The core outreach philosophy. Every message should follow this 4-step pattern:

### Step 1: Observation
Open with something specific about THEIR situation. Shows you did your homework.

**Twitter example:** "Saw your thread about Gong's pricing hitting $120/seat — that's brutal for a 15-person team."
**Reddit example:** "Your breakdown of transcription tools in this thread is solid. Noticed you didn't mention the compliance angle though."
**LinkedIn example:** "Your post about scaling the SDR team from 5 to 20 resonated — that's exactly the inflection point where call recording becomes non-negotiable."
**Email example:** "Subject: Your team's 47 discovery calls last month // I noticed [Company] posted 3 AE roles this quarter..."

### Step 2: Expertise Question
Ask a question that demonstrates you understand their domain deeply. Not a generic question — one that shows you've been in their shoes.

**Examples:**
- "Are you tracking talk-to-listen ratio across your team, or just recording and hoping reps self-correct?"
- "Curious — when your legal team reviews calls, are they listening to full recordings or just reading transcripts?"
- "How are you handling the compliance piece when reps record across state lines?"

### Step 3: Micro-Insight
Offer one piece of genuine value. Free. No strings. This is what separates outreach from spam.

**Examples:**
- "FWIW, the teams I've seen get the most ROI from call recording aren't the ones reviewing every call — they're the ones using AI to surface the 3-4 calls per week that actually need attention."
- "Quick data point: teams that track talk ratio see 23% faster ramp for new hires. The recording itself is table stakes — it's the analysis layer that moves the needle."
- "One thing most people miss: if your reps are in California, you need two-party consent even if your HQ is in a one-party state. Worth a quick legal check."

### Step 4: Curiosity Bridge
NOT a pitch. A bridge that makes them want to continue the conversation. Soft CTA.

**Examples:**
- "We've been building something that tackles this exact problem. Happy to share what's working if you're curious."
- "Would it be useful if I shared the framework our early customers use for call coaching? Takes about 10 minutes to set up."
- "If you want, I can show you what the analysis looks like on a real call — no commitment, just interesting to see."

## Platform Execution Guides

### Twitter/X

**Replies (to tweets/threads):**
- Keep under 280 characters when possible
- Reference the specific tweet content
- Conversational tone, not corporate
- No links in first reply (looks spammy)
- If thread has multiple participants, reply to the person with the pain point

**DMs:**
- Only DM if they followed you or engaged with your content first (cold DMs get reported)
- 2-3 sentences max
- Reference the specific tweet that prompted the DM
- One clear CTA
- No links in first DM

**Rate limits:**
- Max 5 outreach DMs per day
- Max 10 outreach replies per day
- Space replies at least 15 minutes apart (avoid looking automated)

**Voice:** Punchy, direct, slightly casual. Use contractions. No corporate speak.

### Reddit

**IMPORTANT:** Read workspace-outreach/SOP-REDDIT-OUTREACH.md for the full Reddit outreach SOP. The SOP overrides anything below that conflicts.

**First message rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- Goal of message 1: Start a conversation. No pitch. No product name.
- Reference something specific from their post.
- Deliver one useful observation or reframe.
- End with a question (easy to answer in 1-2 sentences).
- **No links. No "Check out my tool." No product name. No "demo?" on touch 1.**
- Use "I" not "we"
- Casual, authentic, zero sales energy
- NEVER start with "As a [title]..." or "Disclaimer: I work for..."

**Product name (CallVault) only appears in touch 2+** after they reply and engage.

**Rate limits:**
- 5-10 messages per hour per account; mix subreddits
- Minimum 2 hours between comments in the same subreddit
- Never post in the same thread twice
- Check subreddit rules before posting (some ban self-promotion entirely)

**Follow-up cadence (if no reply):**
- Day 2: Extra value, no pitch
- Day 5: Final touch, offer to close the loop
- Then mark "No response" and move on

**Voice:** Like talking to a smart friend. Direct, helpful, zero sales energy.

**Humanize pass (REQUIRED on every draft):**
Read workspace-outreach/SOP-REDDIT-OUTREACH.md > Step 3b for the full checklist. Summary:
- Vary openers (never start 2+ messages the same way in a batch)
- Use contractions always
- Mix sentence lengths (short hits + longer rambling thoughts)
- Kill marketing speak ("leverage" "unlock" "insights" "solution" "at scale" "resonate")
- Eliminate most commas. Use ellipses (...) instead of em dashes
- Start lowercase sometimes. Let formatting be slightly messy
- Add one human imperfection per message (throwaway aside, half-thought, "tbh", parenthetical)
- Read aloud: if it sounds like a pitch deck rewrite. if it sounds like a bar conversation ship it
- Target 60-100 words under 80 ideal
- Key AI tells to avoid: identical sentence rhythm, too-precise phrasing, zero mess, personality at 3

### LinkedIn

**Connection requests (with note):**
- Reference their profile, company, or a recent post
- Professional but human — not stiff
- Max 300 characters for connection note
- Lead with mutual interest, not pitch
- CTA: "Would love to connect and swap notes"

**InMails/Messages:**
- Professional tone, reference their profile/company/recent posts
- Lead with a question, not a statement
- Max 150 words first message
- CTA: "Open to a 10-minute call?" or "Worth a quick look?"
- Include one specific, relevant data point

**Rate limits:**
- Max 25 connection requests per week
- Max 5 InMails per day
- Space messages at least 30 minutes apart

**Voice:** Professional but warm. Reference specifics from their profile. Show you did your homework.

### Email

**Subject lines:**
- Pain point or outcome, NEVER company name
- Keep under 50 characters
- Personalize: use their company name, metric, or specific challenge
- Examples: "Your team's call coaching gap", "[Company]'s 47 discovery calls", "Quick question about [specific challenge]"

**Body structure:**
1. Hook (reference them, not you) — 1 sentence
2. Observation + expertise question — 2 sentences
3. Micro-insight — 1-2 sentences
4. Soft CTA — 1 sentence
5. Signature

**Rate limits:**
- Max 20 cold emails per day
- If using a new domain, warm up: 5/day week 1, 10/day week 2, 15/day week 3, 20/day week 4+
- Send between 8am-11am or 1pm-3pm recipient's timezone
- Never send on weekends

**CAN-SPAM compliance:**
- Physical address in signature
- Unsubscribe mechanism
- Accurate From/Reply-To
- No misleading subject lines

**Voice:** Direct, specific, respectful of their time. First-person founder voice.

## Follow-Up Cadence

For sent outreach with no response:

| Days After Send | Action | Template Type |
|----------------|--------|---------------|
| 7 | Soft follow-up | follow-up-soft |
| 14 | Value-add follow-up (share resource) | follow-up-value |
| 21 | Breakup message | follow-up-breakup |
| 30+ | Archive. Revisit in 90 days. | none |

### Follow-up rules:
- Each follow-up must go through the approval chain (bizdev drafts -> Andrew approves -> outreach sends)
- Reference the original message: "Following up on my note about [topic]"
- Each follow-up must add new value (don't just bump)
- Breakup message: "Should I close your file?" — creates urgency without pressure
- After breakup with no response: STOP. Move to monitoring. Do not send again for 90 days.

## A/B Testing Framework

Track these metrics for every outreach message:
- **Approach type:** authority_through_curiosity | value_first | social_engagement | direct_ask
- **Platform:** twitter | reddit | linkedin | email
- **Response:** yes/no
- **Response time:** hours until first response
- **Outcome:** conversation | meeting_booked | objection | no_response

Weekly analysis:
- Which approach type gets highest response rate per platform?
- Which time of day gets best engagement?
- Which templates outperform?
- Report findings to main for strategy adjustment.

## Objection Handling

Common objections and framework responses (personalize per lead):

**"We already use [competitor]":**
-> "Totally makes sense — [competitor] is solid for [their strength]. Curious though, are you finding [known weakness of that competitor]? That's the gap we keep hearing about."

**"Too expensive / no budget right now":**
-> "Completely understand. Quick question — what's the current cost of [problem they have]? Sometimes the math looks different when you factor in [specific ROI metric]."

**"Not the right time":**
-> "No worries at all. When does [trigger event — renewal, next quarter, hiring] come up? Happy to reconnect then with some fresh data."

**"We handle this internally":**
-> "Smart. What does your current process look like? [Ask genuine question about their workflow]. Some teams find the internal approach works great until [scale trigger]."

**"Send me more info":**
-> "Absolutely. Rather than a generic deck, let me send something specific to [their use case/company]. What's the biggest challenge your team is facing with [domain]?"
