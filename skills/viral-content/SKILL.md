# Viral Content Creation Skill

Read BUSINESS.md for business-specific context (product, ICP, competitors, voice).

## Voice Profile

Think: Levelsio meets Hormozi. Building in public with receipts. Zero marketing polish.

**Sound like:** @levelsio (building in public, real numbers, casual, ships constantly), Hormozi (value-first, frameworks, specific numbers), Dickie Bush (atomic ideas, one insight per post), Dan Koe (long-form wisdom, identity-level content)

**Do NOT sound like:** LinkedIn influencers, marketing teams, motivational speakers, AI slop

**Voice rules:**
- First person. "I" not "We." Contractions always.
- Specific numbers over vague claims. "$47K MRR" not "significant growth"
- Admit failures and trade-offs. Vulnerability > polish.
- Profanity sparingly, only when it adds punch.
- Read aloud test: press release = rewrite. Texting a founder friend = ship.

**Banned phrases (auto-delete):**
"In today's fast-paced world" | "Let's dive in" | "Here's the thing" | "Game-changer" | "Revolutionary" | "Unlock" | "Leverage" | "Solution" | "At scale" | "Deep dive" | "Resonate" | "Move the needle" | "Insights" | "Take your X to the next level" | "Like if you agree" | "Synergy" | "Paradigm shift" | "Best-in-class" | "Empower" | "Ecosystem" | "Seamless" | "Cutting-edge" | "Robust"

## Core Mental Model: Authority Not Celebrity (Wiz of Ecom)

**The Celebrity** optimizes for engagement (likes, RTs). Attracts everyone. Problem: average people have ZERO interest in investing. Result: massive following, TINY lead flow.

**The Authority** optimizes for BUYERS. Attracts a smaller but investment-ready audience. Result: micro following (<10K), MASSIVE lead flow. People with <5,000 followers close multi-6-figure deals.

**We are building an Authority, not a Celebrity.** Every content decision flows from this.

## Content Objectives (33/33/33 Rule)

Every post must serve ONE of 3 objectives. Each gets ~33% of output:

**1. Technical (33%)** — Nurtures current followers. Teaches specific STEPS. "Here are 6 strategies to do X." "My system to do Y." CRITICAL: technical content alone doesn't convert anymore because everyone posts it. Still vital for nurturing but can't be your only type.

**2. Authority (33%)** — Gets people to trust you. Leverages "headlines" — impressive results and proof. "I generated $X in revenue with ___." Use authoritative headline as your hook. Plays on psychology: we are shallow, we care about crazy numbers and results.

**3. Story (33%)** — Makes audience connect with you. Personal narratives with END LESSONS. People don't care about stories for stories' sake — they want a key takeaway. Story-based long forms, videos, tweets — format doesn't matter, the lesson does.

**Plus: Business Takes & Hot Takes (1-2/week)** — Opinions, industry commentary. Not part of the 33/33/33 but a regular addition.

If content doesn't follow one of these 3 objectives, it has no purpose. Delete it.

- Visual breakdowns weekly
- Engagement: befriend commenters, reply with questions, jump into calls

## Content Matrix (Welsh Framework)

Generate content by combining **Themes** x **Styles**. One theme + one style = one post.

**Themes** (from BUSINESS.md pillars — weighted by priority): AI agents & automation (40%) | Building in public (25%) | Sales & business strategy (20%) | Hot takes & industry (10%) | Product spotlights - CallVault/Chronicle/Carousel Forge (5%)

**Styles:** X vs Y | Listicle | Observation | Contrarian | Actionable how-to | Analytical breakdown | Storytelling | Present vs Future

Pick 3-5 unique Theme+Style combos per batch. Never duplicate combos.

---

## Hook Library

The hook is the ONLY thing that matters for distribution. Write hooks LAST after the body (Welsh method).

**Transformation:** "[Small] -> [Big] in [timeframe]. Here's how." | "I went from [bad] to [good]. No [expensive thing]." | "6 months ago I [embarrassing]. Today I [impressive]. The difference was [one insight]."

**Contrarian:** "Unpopular opinion: [common practice] is killing your [outcome]." | "Stop [common advice]. It's why you're stuck at [plateau]." | "The [industry] advice that cost me $[amount]:"

**Curiosity:** "I [impressive result]. But the method will surprise you." | "Nobody talks about this, but [hidden pattern] is why [problem] happens."

**Data:** "I analyzed [X] [things]. Here's what [Y]% had in common." | "$[amount] in revenue from [one tactic]. Breakdown below."

**Story:** "I almost [dramatic consequence]. Then [unexpected turn]." | "My worst [event] taught me more than my best one."

**Build in Public:** "Day [X] of building [thing]. [Surprising update]." | "[Milestone]. No team. No funding. No [thing people assume]."

**Anti-Guru:** "Nobody selling [course/service] wants you to know this." | "Free advice that's better than most [expensive thing]:"

**Question:** "What would you do if [specific scenario]?" | "Serious question for [role]: How are you handling [challenge]?"

## LinkedIn Strategy (Scripe.io + Wiz of Ecom)

LinkedIn is NOT Twitter with a suit. But expansion IS effortless — rip winning content from Twitter.

**7 LinkedIn posts/week:** Winning long forms from Twitter | Winning creative images | Engagement tweet screenshots | Promotional tweets with value

**What works:** Carousels (11.2x impressions vs text) | Long-form text | Short video (<30s) | Expert frameworks get visibility boost

**What kills reach:** External links (60% penalty) | Engagement bait (detected/penalized) | Video (deprioritized 2025-2026) | Company pages (personal gets 561% more reach)

**Rules:** Professional but warm, not corporate. White space critical. 3 hashtags max. Hook → Story → Insight → Takeaway → Soft CTA. Failures > successes in performance.

---

## Algorithm Optimization (X/Twitter 2026)

**Signal weights:** Author replies +75x | Reposts 20x | Replies 13.5x | Bookmarks 10x | Likes 1x

**Rules:** Text > video by 30%. No external links in main tweet (30-50% penalty). 1-2 niche hashtags max. Reply to EVERY comment in first hour (biggest lever). Thread > single tweet. Premium = 4x visibility boost.

**Bookmark-worthy content (10x signal):** Checklists, frameworks, step-by-step breakdowns, data/benchmarks, swipe file material

---

## Reddit Content Rules

**Philosophy:** Long game. LLMs cite Reddit at 40.1%. Every quality post = permanent marketing via AI citation.

**Proof Without Pitch:** Context (1 sentence) → Problem → Data (3-7 metrics) → Method (works WITHOUT your product) → Tradeoffs → Disclosure

**Cadence:** 90% contribution, 10% transparent mention (over 6+ months). 3 days/week: 5-7 comments. 1 day/week: proof post. 14 days activity before any mention.

---

## Humanize Pass (REQUIRED — run every draft)

1. **Opener Variety** — No 2 consecutive posts with same opening pattern
2. **Sentence Rhythm** — Mix short punchy + longer rambling. Three medium = robot.
3. **Kill Marketing Speak** — Auto-delete banned phrases. Replace with normal words.
4. **One Imperfection** — Throwaway aside, parenthetical, "tbh", "fwiw", self-correction
5. **Bar Test** — Sounds like a deck → rewrite. Sounds like talking → ship.
6. **Twitter formatting** — Short paragraphs, white space, no emoji walls, numbers break up text
7. **Reddit formatting** — Eliminate commas, use ellipses, lowercase sometimes, messy texture

---

## Thread Framework (Welsh Backward-Build)

1. Write body first (1 idea per tweet, scannable with white space)
2. Write CTA second (one clear action)
3. Write hook LAST (must match content quality)

**Structure:** Tweet 1 = Hook | Tweets 2-6 = One idea each, escalating value | Last tweet = CTA + key insight. 3-7 tweets ideal. Each must stand alone if screenshotted.

---

## Propaganda & Positioning (Wiz of Ecom)

**The Formula:** Identity + Purpose + Common Enemy = Cult-Like Following

Define YOUR version: What identity do followers adopt? What purpose unites them? What common enemy do they fight against?

**5 Positioning Structures:**
1. Removing an old pain
2. Bringing their dream to reality
3. Niche within a niche specialist
4. The old ways are dead
5. Our unique mechanism

Summarize your message into simple phrases (memetics) that reinforce it. All content revolves around selling people your convictions.

---

## Idea Generation: The Interview Method

Answer these about yourself/your business to generate months of content:
- Personal stories relevant to business? Biggest successes and why? Advice for beginners?
- Things you're still improving? Trends in your industry? 4-5 business takes worth expanding?
- Your typical day? Daily habits? Your story (milestones from start to now)?
- Accomplishments that make good headlines? Biggest industry lessons? Common mistakes you see?
- Biggest failures? Important principles people should know? Skills for success?
- Biggest beginner mistakes? Main thing to promote? What are you most passionate about?

---

## Optimization & Testing Cycle

**Every 15 days:**
1. Analyze what topics and structures are working
2. Figure out what content styles do best
3. Double down on winners
4. Cut or modify losers
5. Run new tests with different content vehicles
6. Study what competitors and others are talking about

**Per 10-post window:** Track impressions, engagement rate, replies, bookmarks, profile clicks. After 48hrs: categorize Winner (top 20%), Average (60%), Loser (bottom 20%). Replicate winner patterns. Avoid loser patterns.

**A/B test:** 2 hooks for same content | Same content as text vs thread vs carousel | Same hook at different times

---

## Content Generation Workflow

1. **Read research.** Check research/YYYY-MM-DD.json for today's trends
2. **Pick combos.** Select 3-5 Theme+Style combinations from Content Matrix
3. **Map to content types.** Assign each to one of the 18 content types
4. **Draft bodies first.** Write insight/value. No hooks yet.
5. **Write hooks.** Pick from Hook Library. Must match body's value.
6. **Humanize pass.** Run every draft through checklist.
7. **Check distribution.** Maintain 33/33/33 objective ratio and Post Type Distribution over recent 10-post window.
8. **Quality gate.** Would I bookmark this? Bar test pass? Specific number/example? Hook attention-grabbing? Voice rules followed? Valuable without product name?
9. **Score and queue.** Rate 1-10, add to post-queue.json.

If any quality gate answer is "no" — rewrite or discard. Never ship mid-quality.
